/// FAB) takes ~1.5s before the server reports it as running, and the banner
/// then adds its own 1s appear-debounce on top — so without this the banner
/// sat blank for a couple of seconds after a pull and the action felt dead.
///
/// Callers [arm] this the instant they fire an update, which shows the banner
/// immediately (bypassing the debounce). It then hands back to the real
/// running signal: [onRealRunning] releases the optimistic hold once the
/// genuine run has been seen to start and then end, and a safety timeout
/// releases it for updates that never register as running (nothing to check /
/// failed to start).
