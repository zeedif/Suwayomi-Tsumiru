A polished, native client for reading manga &amp; manhwa from a
<a href="https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server">Suwayomi-Server</a> instance —
built for long webtoon binges on your phone.

> **Tsumiru** *(積みる)* — a play on *tsundoku* (積ん読), the art of letting unread
> books pile up. For everyone whose backlog grows faster than they can read it.

## What it is

Tsumiru is an enhanced fork of [Tachidesk-Sorayomi](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk-Sorayomi),
the Flutter client for the self-hosted [Suwayomi-Server](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server)
manga server. It connects to a server you already run — it is a reader, not a server.

Runs on **Android, Linux, Windows, macOS, and Web**.

## What's different from upstream Sorayomi

This fork focuses on making it a great daily driver, especially for **webtoon / manhwa** reading:

- **Rebuilt webtoon reader** — smooth, seamless multi-chapter continuous scrolling, tuned for long manhwa strips.
- **Pinch-to-zoom** that keeps working while you scroll, including in the continuous reader.
- **Authentication** — `simple_login` and `ui_login`, with credentials kept in your device's secure storage.
- **Flexible library** — sort by last read, last chapter date, or total chapters; filter by reading status and bookmarks; and queue chapters fast with bulk-download presets.

## Download

Grab the latest build for your platform from the
[**Releases**](https://github.com/aaronbamblett/tsumiru/releases/latest) page
(Android APKs — universal + per-ABI — plus Linux, Windows, macOS, and Web).

**Android, with auto-updates:** add this repo to
[Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) and it will install and keep
Tsumiru updated straight from GitHub Releases — no app store needed.

## Requirements

You need a running [Suwayomi-Server](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server)
that Tsumiru can reach. On first launch, point it at your server's address.

## Building

Flutter 3.32.4 / Dart 3.8.1 (pinned).

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter gen-l10n
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter build apk            # or: linux / windows / macos / web
```
