## What it is

Tsumiru is a Flutter client for [Suwayomi-Server](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server),
the self-hosted manga server. You point it at a server you already run. Tsumiru itself
is only the reader (the server handles sources and downloads).

Runs on **Android, Linux, Windows, macOS, and Web**.

## Feature highlights

Tsumiru is built for daily reading, especially **webtoons / manhwa**:

- **Offline reading:** download chapters to your device and read them with no connection to your server. Tsumiru keeps an on-device catalog with auto-keep rules and falls back to local copies automatically when the server isn't reachable.
- **Rebuilt webtoon reader:** multi-chapter continuous scrolling tuned for long manhwa strips, with pinch-to-zoom that keeps working while you scroll.
- **First-run onboarding:** a guided setup that finds your Suwayomi server on the network and walks you through connecting it.
- **Incognito mode:** pause reading history while you catch up, plus hideable library categories (Komikku parity).
- **13 built-in themes:** plus a custom accent colour and an AMOLED black mode.
- **Native authentication:** `simple_login` and `ui_login`, with credentials kept in your device's secure storage.
- **Flexible library:** sort by last read, last chapter date, or total chapters; filter by reading status and bookmarks; and queue whole chapter ranges with bulk-download presets.

## Download

Grab the latest build for your platform from the
[**Releases**](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Tsumiru/releases/latest) page
(Android APKs — universal + per-ABI — plus Linux, Windows, macOS, and Web).

**Android, with auto-updates:** add this repo to
[Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) and it will install and keep
Tsumiru updated straight from GitHub Releases (no app store needed).

## Requirements

You need a running [Suwayomi-Server](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server)
that Tsumiru can reach. On first launch, point it at your server's address.

## Building

Flutter 3.44.6 (pinned via `.fvmrc`; Dart SDK ≥3.9).

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter gen-l10n
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter build apk            # or: linux / windows / macos / web
```
